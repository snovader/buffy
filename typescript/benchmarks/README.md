# Benchmarks

`yarn bench` times `@buffy/core`'s getters and setters of every element type
on their own, and `yarn bench:compare` compares the package with other
JavaScript libraries. Run both from `typescript/`.

## Comparison

The comparison times buffy and other JavaScript libraries that encode small
tables and typed numeric columns, on generic table shapes:

- **record**: one table of two float64s, an int64 and a 16-byte string.
- **document of 100 and 100,000 rows**: a sized, versioned table of two
  float64s and a string, with a nested table of an int64 and three columns, a
  Uint32 and two Float32.
- **vector of 100 nested tables**: a table holding a vector of tables, each a
  float32 and a nested table of two float32s.
- **fixed-size record**: a uint32 and two float32s at fixed offsets, written
  with `StructWriter` and read with `readUint32()`/`readFloat32()`.

Each shape is serialized and deserialized, with columns read back as typed
arrays. Documents are also serialized from `number[]` columns, and a column is
summed through each library's per-element accessor. The suite also prints
encoded sizes and what each library does with a truncated document.

### Libraries

| Library               | Why it's comparable                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flatbuffers` 25.9.23 | Zero-copy tables with offsets and vectors, like buffy. flatc's generated code is in `comparison/generated/`.      |
| `protobufjs` 8.8.1    | The most used protobuf runtime, with packed repeated floats. Decoding copies into `number[]`.                     |
| `msgpackr` 2.1.2      | A fast schemaless format that packs typed arrays as byte copies. The suite uses its plain JavaScript entry point. |

### Method

Each group runs its variants interleaved, in alternating order, over 31 rounds
by default, after 10 warm-up rounds, and reports the fastest call. Load from
other processes then slows every variant alike, and only for some rounds.
Every variant has its own timer loop, compiled from a unique source, so that
call sites and type feedback aren't shared. Groups with `number[]` inputs run
last, since they change the type feedback of code the typed-array groups
share. Before timing, every codec must read back exactly what it wrote.

### Running

```sh
uptime
yarn bench:compare --rounds 41
```

`--filter <regex>` runs only the matching groups, and `--sample-ms` sets how
long one round of one variant takes (1 ms by default). Check `uptime` first:
a high load from other processes makes even the minimum unreliable.

### Limitations

- Node has wider Smis than V8 builds with pointer compression, such as
  Cloudflare's workerd, so integer-heavy code can run differently there.
- protobufjs generates its codecs with `new Function`, which Workers don't
  allow. `pbjs` emits the same code as a static module for that.
- msgpackr packs successive messages into one shared buffer and returns views
  of it, so it allocates once for many messages. The other libraries allocate
  a buffer for each message.
